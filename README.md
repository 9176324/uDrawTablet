uDrawTablet
===========

This is a C# .NET 2.0 PC "driver"/application for simulating mouse movements with the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360 uDraw GameTablets.

If using the Xbox 360 tablet, make sure to install LibUsbDotNet and use the "USB InfWizard" to create a driver for your USB wireless receiver and install it first.

Just run it and configure via the notification area icon.
